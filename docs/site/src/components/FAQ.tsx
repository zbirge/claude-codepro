    question: "What is Claude CodePro?",
    answer: "Claude CodePro is a professional development environment for Claude Code. It provides Endless Mode for unlimited context, spec-driven development, TDD enforcement, persistent memory, semantic search, quality hooks, and a modular rules system - all running inside a Dev Container.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is Endless Mode?",
    answer: "Endless Mode removes the 200K context limit. When context nears the limit, it automatically saves state and continues in a new session - zero manual intervention required. Works in both Spec-Driven and Quick modes.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the two development modes?",
    answer: "Spec-Driven Mode (/spec) creates a plan for your approval before implementation - great for new features. Quick Mode lets you just chat for bug fixes and small changes. Both modes get Endless Mode, TDD enforcement, and quality hooks.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Claude CodePro free?",
    answer: "Free for individuals, freelancers, and open source projects under AGPL-3.0. Companies using it in proprietary/closed-source products need a commercial license. Contact zach@birge-consulting.com for licensing.",
  },
  {
    question: "What IDEs are supported?",
    answer: "Claude CodePro works with VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and Antigravity. Any IDE with Dev Containers extension support should work. The experience is consistent across all supported IDEs.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need Docker?",
    answer: "Yes, you need a container runtime like Docker Desktop or OrbStack (macOS). Claude CodePro runs inside a Dev Container to provide complete isolation, consistent tooling, and cross-platform compatibility.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I contribute or request features?",
    answer: "Pull requests are welcome! If you want a feature, submit a PR. For custom development or enterprise needs, contact zach@birge-consulting.com.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer professional services?",
    answer: "For professional services, custom development, enterprise integration, or consulting, contact zach@birge-consulting.com.",
