## 📦 What's Inside

<img src="https://www.claude-code.pro/assets/ide-screenshot-Bg67Az9Q.png" alt="IDE Screenshot" width="600">

### 📋 Token-Optimized Spec-Driven Workflow via Slash Commands
- `/plan` - Based on your input asks the right questions → Detailed spec with exact code (Opus 4.1)
- `/implement` - Execute spec with mandatory TDD → Auto-manages context when full (Sonnet 4.5)
- `/remember` - Stores learnings in cross-session memory → Continue after /clear (Sonnet 4.5)
- `/verify` - E2E spec verification with CodeRabbit AI review → All tests, quality, security (Sonnet 4.5)

### 💡 Auto-Enforce Best Practices and Standards via Skills
- **Testing Skills** - TDD, test writing, anti-patterns, debugging, verification, code review
- **Global Skills** - Coding style, commenting, conventions, error handling, validation
- **Backend Skills** - API design, models, queries, migrations
- **Frontend Skills** - Components, CSS, accessibility, responsive design

### 🔌 Enhanced Context and Capabilities via MCP Servers
- **Cipher & Claude Context** - Cross-session memory and semantic code search for optimal context
- **Context7 & Ref** - Up-to-date library documentation with limited context blur
- **DBHub & FireCrawl** - Database access and web scraping for dynamic data retrieval
- **MCP Funnel** - Allows to plug-in more MCP servers as needed without wasting context

### 🛠️ Testing and Quality via Automated Tool Installation
- **CodeRabbit** - AI-powered code review for quality and security
- **Qlty** - Automated code quality hooks for all programming languages
- **Newman** - API end-to-end testing with Postman collections
- **uv, ruff, mypy, basedpyright** - Python linter, formatter, and type checker

### 🏗️ Automated Dev Container Setup (VS Code / Cursor / Windsurf)
- **Integrated Features** - Zsh, Node.js, Docker-in-Docker, uv, ruff, basedpyright, git, fzf
- **IDE Extensions** - Python, Docker, SQL, testing, formatting, and development tools
- **CLI Tools** - qlty, Claude Code, Statusline, dotenvx, CodeRabbit, Cipher, Newman
- **Local Database** - Local PostgreSQL instance on port 5433 for development and testing

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📋 Prerequisites

- **[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)** or **[OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/download)**
- **[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** or **[Cursor](https://cursor.com/)** or **[Windsurf](https://windsurf.dev/)**
- **[Dev Containers Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)**
- **Optional**: **[Warp](https://www.warp.dev/)** for the best terminal experience

### 📥 Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/maxritter/claude-codepro.git`
2. Open in VS Code, click on the button on the bottom-left: `Reopen in Container` or open the command pallette via `Ctrl + Shift + P` and then use `> Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`
3. Wait for automatic build to finish, this can take a couple of minutes (feel free to watch the logs in `vscode`)
<img src="docs/img/ide-setup-finish.png" alt="Setup finish Screenshot" width="600">

4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your credentials and API keys
```bash
cp .env.example .env
vim .env
```
5. Run `cc` (which is an alias we created) in the Terminal to finish CC Setup, `cr` to finish CodeRabbit setup
```bash
# alias to spawn claude code with loaded environment varaibles
cc
# code rabbit cmd line tool and setup
cr
```

---

## 📒 How-to-use

### ⚙️ Configuration

1. In CC, run `/config` to set auto-connect to IDE to true and set `Auto-compact=false` for best experience
<img src="docs/img/ide-setup-config.png" alt="Setup config Screenshot" width="600">

2. In CC, run `/ide` to connect to VS Code diagnostics and make sure all MCP servers for `/mcp` are online
<img src="docs/img/ide-setup-mcp.png" alt="Setup mcp Screenshot" width="600">

3. In VS Code, click `START` in the lower bar of the IDE to start a split terminal and monitor CC usage with `/usage`. (see screenshot of the *Installation* section)

4. Open Claude Code in the IDE Terminal, Extension or an external Terminal like Warp with the `cc` command

### 👣 First Steps

- Start with `/plan` - Provide your input and it will ask clarifying questions to create a spec
- Use `/implement` to execute the spec with automatic TDD, best practices and context management
- When context fills, `/remember` automatically updates your plan and stores learnings
- After spec completion, run `/verify` to run CodeRabbit AI review, all tests, and quality checks

## ⚖️ What Makes This Different

**Compared to Other Spec-Driven Frameworks (OpenSpec, SpecKit, AgentOS):**

- 💾 **Persistent Memory** - Cross-session memory maintains knowledge between resets
- ⚡ **Token-Optimized** - No tokens wasted during too complex planning, just works
- ✅ **Production-Grade** - Actively used in client and enterprise projects
- 📝 **Enforced TDD** - Code written before tests gets deleted automatically
- 💯 **Real Verification** - Must show actual outputs based on tests, not assumptions
- 🛠️ **Complete Ecosystem** - Skills, MCP servers, testing tools are integrated and configured
- 📦 **Works Immediately** - Pre-configured automated setup with everything you need

---

## 👥 Who This Is For

- **Professional Developers** - Shipping to production with quality standards
- **Solo Builders** - Managing complex features without losing context
- **Engineering Teams** - Ensuring consistent TDD and code quality
- **Frustrated Coders** - Tired of half-tested, "should work" implementations
