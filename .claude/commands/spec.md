# /spec - Spec-Driven Development

**For new features, major changes, and complex work.** Creates a spec, gets your approval, implements with TDD, and verifies completion.

**Prerequisite:** Run `/setup` once before first use to initialize project context.

## Arguments

```
/spec <task-description>           # Start new workflow from task
/spec <path/to/plan.md>            # Continue existing plan
/spec --continue <path/to/plan.md> # Resume after session clear
```

## ⛔ CRITICAL: NEVER STOP BETWEEN PHASES

**This is the #1 rule of /spec: NEVER stop between phases.**

After ANY skill (/plan, /implement, /verify) completes:
1. **IMMEDIATELY re-read the plan file status**
2. **IMMEDIATELY invoke the next skill based on status**
3. **NEVER just announce what will happen next - DO IT**

❌ **WRONG:** "The workflow will now continue to implementation..."
✅ **RIGHT:** `Skill(implement, "docs/plans/...")` [actually invoke it]

**The ONLY time you stop is:**
- When plan needs user approval (handled by /plan skill asking via AskUserQuestion)
- When Status is VERIFIED (workflow complete)
- When context >= 90% (hand off to next session)

## Use the Skill Tool

**You MUST use the Skill tool to invoke /plan, /implement, and /verify.**

```
Skill tool with: skill="plan", args="task description here"
Skill tool with: skill="implement", args="path/to/plan.md"
Skill tool with: skill="verify", args="path/to/plan.md"
```

## Workflow Logic

Parse the arguments: $ARGUMENTS

### Step 1: Determine Current State

```
IF arguments start with "--continue":
    plan_path = extract path after "--continue"

    ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Check continuation file first
    1. Read /tmp/claude-continuation.md if it exists (for session context)
    2. Delete the continuation file after reading
    3. Read plan file, check Status AND Approved fields, continue workflow

ELIF arguments end with ".md" AND file exists:
    plan_path = arguments
    → Read plan file, check Status AND Approved fields

ELSE:
    task_description = arguments
    → Use Skill tool to run /plan with task_description
    → /plan handles user approval internally via AskUserQuestion
    → After /plan completes, RE-READ plan status and continue (DO NOT STOP)
```

### Session Resume (--continue)

**When `--continue` is detected, follow this sequence:**

1. **Check for continuation file:**
   ```bash
   cat /tmp/claude-continuation.md 2>/dev/null
   ```
   If it exists, read it for context about what was happening before the clear.

2. **Clean up the continuation file:**
   ```bash
   rm -f /tmp/claude-continuation.md
   ```

3. **Read the plan file** and continue based on Status field.

The continuation file provides guaranteed context even if Claude Mem injection is delayed.

### Step 2: Execute Based on Status (FEEDBACK LOOP)

**This step is a LOOP that continues until Status is VERIFIED.**

After reading the plan file's Status and Approved fields:

| Status | Approved | Action |
|--------|----------|--------|
| PENDING | No | **⛔ STOP** - Request user approval (Step 2a) |
| PENDING | Yes | Use Skill tool to run /implement with plan-path |
| COMPLETE | * | Use Skill tool to run /verify with plan-path |
| VERIFIED | * | Report completion and ask follow-up (Step 3) |

**⚠️ CRITICAL: After /verify completes, RE-READ the plan file status!**

```
LOOP:
  1. Read plan file status
  2. Dispatch based on status (table above)
  3. After skill completes, go back to step 1
  4. EXIT loop only when: Status == VERIFIED OR context >= 90%
```

**Why this matters:**
- /verify may find issues and set Status back to PENDING
- /verify adds fix tasks to the plan
- The loop automatically re-runs /implement to fix issues
- Continues until everything passes (VERIFIED)

**Between iterations:**
1. Check context: `.claude/bin/ccp check-context --json`
2. If context >= 90%: hand off cleanly (don't rush!)
3. If context 80-89%: continue but wrap up current task with quality
4. If context < 80%: continue the loop freely

**Report iteration progress (only after first loop-back):**
```
🔄 Starting Iteration 1 implementation...  (after first verify failure)
✅ Iteration 1: All checks passed - VERIFIED

🔄 Starting Iteration 2 implementation...  (if it loops again)
✅ Iteration 2: All checks passed - VERIFIED
```

### Step 2a: ⛔ MANDATORY User Approval Gate

**When Status is PENDING and Approved is No (or missing), you MUST:**

1. **Summarize the plan for the user** - Provide a brief overview of what will be implemented

2. **Use AskUserQuestion to request approval:**
   ```
   Question: "Do you approve this plan for implementation?"
   Header: "Plan Review"
   Options:
   - "Yes, proceed with implementation" - I've reviewed the plan and it looks good
   - "No, I need to make changes" - I want to edit the plan first
   ```

3. **Based on user response:**

   **If user approves ("Yes, proceed..."):**
   - Edit the plan file to change `Approved: No` to `Approved: Yes`
   - Immediately proceed to run /implement with Skill tool
   - Do NOT ask the user to run another command

   **If user wants changes ("No, I need to make changes"):**
   - Tell user: "Please edit the plan file at `<plan-path>`, then say 'ready' when done"
   - Wait for user to confirm they're done editing
   - Re-read the plan file to see their changes
   - Ask for approval again using AskUserQuestion

4. **DO NOT proceed to /implement until user explicitly approves**

**This gate is NON-NEGOTIABLE. But Claude handles the file update - user never edits `Approved:` manually.**

### Step 3: Post-Verification Follow-up

**When Status is VERIFIED, you MUST:**

1. Report completion with summary
2. Ask the user if there's anything else:
   ```
   ✅ Workflow complete! Plan status: VERIFIED

   Summary:
   - [Brief summary of what was implemented]
   - [Key files created/modified]
   - [Test results]

   Is there anything else you'd like me to help with?
   ```

## Context Monitoring

After each major operation, check context:

```bash
.claude/bin/ccp check-context --json
```

If response shows `"status": "CLEAR_NEEDED"` (context >= 90%):

**Step 1: Write continuation file (GUARANTEED BACKUP)**

Write to `/tmp/claude-continuation.md`:

```markdown
# Session Continuation (/spec)

**Plan:** <plan-path>
**Phase:** [plan|implement|verify]
**Current Task:** Task N - [description]

**Completed This Session:**
- [x] [What was finished]

**Next Steps:**
1. [What to do immediately when resuming]

**Context:**
- [Key decisions or blockers]
```

**Step 2: Trigger session clear**

```bash
.claude/bin/ccp send-clear <plan-path>
```

CCP will restart with `/spec --continue <plan-path>`

## Error Handling

### No Active Session

If `send-clear` fails:
- Tell user: "Context at X%. Please run `/clear` manually, then `/spec --continue <plan-path>`"

### Plan File Not Found

- Tell user: "Plan file not found: <path>"
- Ask if they want to create a new plan

## Execution Flow Example

```
User: /spec "add calculator with tests"

Claude:
1. Use Skill(plan, "add calculator with tests")
   → Plan created at docs/plans/2026-01-07-calculator.md

2. Read plan file, Status: PENDING, Approved: No
   → Summarize the plan for the user
   → Use AskUserQuestion: "Do you approve this plan for implementation?"

User selects: "Yes, proceed with implementation"

3. Edit plan file: change "Approved: No" to "Approved: Yes"
   Use Skill(implement, docs/plans/2026-01-07-calculator.md)
   → All tasks complete, Status: COMPLETE

4. Re-read plan file, Status: COMPLETE
   Use Skill(verify, docs/plans/2026-01-07-calculator.md)
   → Found 2 failing tests, added fix tasks, Status: PENDING, Iterations: 0 → 1

5. 🔄 Re-read plan file, Status: PENDING, Iterations: 1
   Report: "🔄 Starting Iteration 1 implementation..."
   Use Skill(implement, docs/plans/2026-01-07-calculator.md)
   → Fix tasks complete, Status: COMPLETE

6. Re-read plan file, Status: COMPLETE
   Use Skill(verify, docs/plans/2026-01-07-calculator.md)
   → All checks passed, Status: VERIFIED

7. ✅ Read plan file, Status: VERIFIED, Iterations: 1
   Report: "✅ Iteration 1: All checks passed - VERIFIED"
   "Workflow complete! Is there anything else?"
```

**The loop continues automatically until VERIFIED - no manual intervention needed.**

## Quality Over Speed - CRITICAL

**NEVER rush or compromise quality due to context pressure.**

- Context warnings are informational, not emergencies
- Work spans sessions seamlessly - nothing is lost
- Finish the CURRENT task with full quality, then hand off cleanly
- Do NOT skip tests or cut corners to "beat" context limits
- A well-done task split across 2 sessions beats a rushed task in 1

## Important

1. **Run /setup first** - Use `/setup` command to initialize project before first /spec
2. **Always use Skill tool** - don't just describe, actually invoke
3. **NEVER skip user approval** - Use AskUserQuestion to get approval, then update `Approved: Yes` yourself
4. **Feedback loop is automatic** - After /verify, re-read status and continue if not VERIFIED
5. **Plan file is source of truth** - survives session clears
6. **Check context between iterations** - hand off at 90%, wrap up at 80%
7. **Trust the wrapper** - handles session restarts automatically
8. **Always ask follow-up** - After VERIFIED, ask if user needs anything else
9. **Report iteration progress** - Show "🔄 Iteration N" so user sees the loop working
